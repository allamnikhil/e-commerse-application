<p style="text-align:justify;">As of my last knowledge update in june 2024, there wasn't a specific app that could help you locate places that you cannot search for on Google Maps. However, there are some alternative mapping apps and tools that you could consider using to locate places that may not be easily searchable on Google Maps. Here are a few suggestions:
</p><ul style="text-align:justify;"><li>
HERE WeGo is a popular mapping app that offers detailed maps for cities all over the world. It provides offline maps, public transit information, and walking directions.</li>
<li>MapQuest: MapQuest is another mapping service that offers driving directions, maps, and satellite imagery. It may have different data sources than Google Maps, so you might find information on MapQuest that isn't available on Google Maps.
</li><li>OpenStreetMap: OpenStreetMap is a collaborative mapping project where users contribute to creating and updating the maps. It can sometimes have more detailed or up-to-date information for certain areas compared to commercial mapping services like Google Maps.
</li><li>Wikimapia: Wikimapia is a collaborative mapping project that combines a map with a wiki system, allowing users to add information about specific locations. It can be useful for finding information about specific places that may not be well-known or easily searchable on other mapping platforms.
</li><li>Local guide websites or forums: Sometimes, local guide websites or forums specific to the region you are interested in can provide detailed information about places that may not be easily searchable on mainstream mapping apps.</li><li>
Please note that the availability and features of these apps may have changed since my last update, so I recommend checking the latest information on the respective app stores or websites to see if they meet your specific needs for locating hard-to-find places.</li></ul>
